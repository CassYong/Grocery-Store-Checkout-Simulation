**Grocery Store Checkout Simulation ðŸ›’**

A simulation of grocery store checkout lines using multiple queues to model customer behavior and queue management strategies. This project explores data structures and algorithms for efficient queue handling.

**Features**

âœ… Five checkout lanes managed using a vector of queues

âœ… Customers select the shortest available queue

âœ… Ability to avoid long queues and leave after excessive wait times

âœ… Dynamic queue switching for optimized wait times
